By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## 1. Educational Purpose Only

- HealWise is a **learning companion**. It summarizes publicly available wellness information, generates reflective prompts, and helps you organize grocery lists, journal entries, or planner cards.
- HealWise **does not diagnose, treat, prescribe, triage, or substitute for professional medical advice**. Always consult physicians, pharmacists, nutritionists, or other qualified professionals for personal medical decisions.
- You agree not to rely on the Services to make urgent, emergency, or individualized medical decisions.

## 2. User Responsibilities

You agree to:

1. Use the Services for lawful, educational purposes only.
2. Avoid submitting Protected Health Information (“PHI”), personally identifiable information about others, or any data you do not have the right to share.
3. Refrain from asking the system for medical directives (e.g., “Should I take…?”, “What dose…?”). The app actively blocks such prompts.
4. Keep your devices and accounts secure (e.g., safeguarding API keys for local builds).

## 3. Acceptable Use

You will not:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or misuse the Services or their underlying models.
- Attempt to override moderation, rate limiting, or other guardrails.
- Upload viruses, malicious code, or engage in activities that degrade or disrupt the Services.
- Misrepresent HealWise output as medical advice, professional judgment, or an FDA-cleared tool.

We may suspend or terminate access if we suspect policy violations.

## 4. Intellectual Property

HealWise and its licensors retain all rights, title, and interest in the Services, code, design, logos, and content (excluding data you submit). You may not use HealWise branding without permission.

Any feedback you provide may be used to improve the Services with no obligation or compensation.

## 5. Disclaimers

- THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
- HEALWISE DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT OUTPUTS ARE FACTUAL, COMPLETE, OR ERROR-FREE. ALWAYS CROSS-CHECK WITH PRIMARY SOURCES AND PROFESSIONALS.
- HEALWISE DOES NOT PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES. CALL YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY NUMBER OR CONTACT A LICENSED CLINICIAN FOR URGENT CARE.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, HEALWISE AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS OR DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.

Our total liability for any claim will not exceed USD $100.

## 7. Privacy

Our use of data is described in the [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md). By using the Services, you consent to those practices.

## 8. Changes

We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via the repository, release notes, or in-app notices. Continued use after an update constitutes acceptance.

## 9. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, USA, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Fulton County, Georgia.
